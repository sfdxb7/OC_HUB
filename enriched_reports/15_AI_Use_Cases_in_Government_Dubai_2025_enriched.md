TRANSFORMING LOST & FOUND

# Shaping the Future of Item Recovery in Dubai

# WHY LOST AND FOUND IS A CHALLENGE GLOBALLY

Losing personal belongings is a frustrating and common experience for many people. In the United States alone, Americans spend an estimated $2.7 billion annually to replace lost items<sup>1</sup>. The lost and found industry has traditionally been plagued by inefficient manual processes, making it difficult for owners to recover their lost items.


<!-- Page 28 -->

# KEY STATISTICS

# More than

# 20%

of residents in urban areas report losing personal items annually.

A significant percentage of these items are never recovered, indicating a major issue within the lost and found systems2.

Research indicates that only about

# 50%

of lost items are successfully matched and returned to their owners.

This low recovery rate is attributed to inefficiencies in current lost and found systems<sup>2</sup>.

Surveys reveal that only

# 40%

of individuals believe their lost items would be returned.

This lack of trust in lost and found services further complicates the recovery process for lost belongings<sup>2</sup>.
